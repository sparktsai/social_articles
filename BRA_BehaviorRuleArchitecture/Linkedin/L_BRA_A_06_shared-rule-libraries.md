# What If Rule Libraries Could Be Shared?

### A small thought experiment about reusable engineering rules

While building BRA, I originally thought of the Rule Library as something that could be shared.

The idea was simple.

If a Rule is already structured, versioned, and reusable, why should it remain inside one project?

A Rule Library could be published.

Another developer could download it.

A team could use only the Rules they need.

A company could modify them according to its own governance requirements.

That led me to another thought.

## What kinds of Rule Libraries could exist?

Maybe there does not need to be one universal Rule Library.

There could be many.

For example:

```text
category: industry
category: domain
category: enterprise
category: product
category: project
category: technical
category: country
category: language
...
```

These are not necessarily levels in a hierarchy.

They are simply different ways of describing where a Rule Library comes from or where it may be useful.

And I do not think the categories need to stop here.

If another useful category appears, it could simply be defined.

More importantly, the same engineering concern may appear in several different Rule Libraries.

## Consider personal data

A common rule might express something like:

> Personal data MUST be encrypted when protection is required during storage or transmission.

That idea is not owned by one particular category.

It could appear in a Web-related Rule Library because data is transmitted between systems.

It could appear in a SaaS Rule Library because customer data is handled by the service.

It could appear in an e-commerce Rule Library because customer and transaction information is involved.

A related Rule about response time might make sense in a SaaS context.

Another variation might matter specifically to an e-commerce system.

So I am less interested in defining the "correct" category for a Rule.

I am more interested in this possibility:

> **The same engineering knowledge can be packaged into different Rule Libraries for different contexts.**

Category becomes a way to organize and discover Rules, not necessarily a rigid hierarchy.

## Then I thought about existing engineering guides

Software engineering already has a lot of this knowledge.

For example, Google has published coding style guides for languages such as Java, JavaScript, and others.

Those documents were written for humans.

But theoretically, some of their engineering guidance could be represented as behavioral Rules.

That creates several possibilities.

A company could transform its own internal development guidelines into:

```text
category: enterprise
```

If those Rules were later shared publicly, perhaps they could also become:

```text
category: technical
```

or:

```text
category: language
language: java
```

The engineering knowledge did not fundamentally change.

What changed was how the Rule Library was being packaged and shared.

That made me wonder how much existing engineering documentation could potentially become reusable AI behavioral Rules.

## And then there is SonarQube

That thought eventually led to another interesting example.

SonarQube already contains many software-quality rules.

Traditionally, those rules are used to inspect code:

```text
Code
↓
Rule
↓
Violation
```

But if some of the engineering knowledge behind those rules can be expressed as AI behavioral constraints, perhaps some could also become part of a language-oriented Rule Library.

For example:

```text
SonarQube Java Rule
↓
Engineering Concern
↓
BRA Rule?
↓
category: language
language: java
```

Not every SonarQube rule will necessarily translate cleanly.

And a SonarQube validation rule is not automatically the same thing as a BRA behavioral Rule.

But the possibility is interesting.

The software industry may already contain large amounts of Rule-like engineering knowledge.

It is simply represented for different consumers.

## Maybe the interesting part is not creating more Rules

This changes how I think about the Rule Library.

At first:

```text
I define Rules
↓
I store them
↓
My project uses them
```

But perhaps the larger possibility is:

```text
Someone defines engineering knowledge
↓
It becomes a Rule Library
↓
Someone else discovers it
↓
Uses it
Modifies it
Combines it
or
Shares it again
```

One library might contain Java Rules.

Another might contain SaaS Rules.

Another might represent a company's engineering practices.

Another might contain Rules derived from security guidance.

Another might be specific to a country, product, project, industry, or technical discipline.

And a Rule does not necessarily have to belong to only one of them.

The categories are not the architecture.

They are simply ways of organizing reusable knowledge.

That is the small experiment I would like to see:

> **What happens if Rule Libraries become shareable engineering assets?**

Maybe the interesting future is not one giant universal Rule Library.

Maybe it is many independently maintained Rule Libraries, representing different kinds of engineering knowledge, that developers and organizations can discover, adapt, and use.

And perhaps we already have much more of that knowledge than we think.

It may just not be represented as AI behavioral Rules yet.
